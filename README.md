 User Registration & Status Toggle Project
This project is a simple PHP web app that lets users submit their name and age through a styled HTML form. The submitted data is saved in a MySQL database. A separate page displays all registered users in a table format, including each userâ€™s status. Each user has a Toggle button that switches their status between inactive and active.

 How it works:
 
1-Users fill out the registration form with their name and age.

2-The form sends the data to a PHP script that connects to a database and stores the information securely.

3-Another page displays all saved users in a table.

4-Each user has a Toggle button to switch their status from 0 to 1 or vice versa.

5-The change appears immediately in the same table for easy tracking
